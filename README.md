# Laptop-Price-Predictor

Source-https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/laptop-prices

In this machine learning project, we aimed to develop a laptop price predictor. We used a dataset from Kaggle, which contained various features related to laptops, such as brand, processor, RAM, storage capacity, and graphics card.

To build the price prediction model, we experimented with multiple regression algorithms, including linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision tree, and random forest regression. After training and evaluating the models, we found that the random forest regression algorithm performed the best, achieving an efficiency of 89%.

By achieving an efficiency of 89%, our laptop price predictor demonstrates strong performance in estimating laptop prices based on their specifications. This model can be useful for both consumers and sellers in understanding the expected price range of a laptop based on its features, aiding in informed decision-making and pricing strategies.
